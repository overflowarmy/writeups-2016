Quick initial static analysis on this program did not yield any specifically interesting results. Hence, GDB was used to start debugging the program.

Again, avoiding conditional jumps by placing breakpoints and jumping over things gave some results. In this case, a segmentation fault error is thrown after a couple jumps. This specific error may indicate that the program is expecting some sort of argument. Hence, we run the program again but this time we give it an argument:

After doing so and continueing on and breaking jumps, we avoid the segfault error and reach the end of the main function which gives us the flag:

The flag is `N080DYK1ll3D8AHU8AL1`.
